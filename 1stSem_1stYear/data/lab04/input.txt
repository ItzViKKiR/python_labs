Closer to the moon

Once in a while, let me go wild
Over the one I couldn't find living
You look kinda tired, things been defined
We're tied up tight through space and time
Breathe in

Will you disappoint me
When I meet you here?
Friend, will you feed me to your void
That someone else cut out deep?

But you make me feel
Closer to the moon
Than I've ever been
Air's cold and clear
If only you were here

Whose is this look through my black glass?
What's it they took from your soul, blessed, pure?
Alas I'm losing my touch with the ground
Did I just levitate or get drowned?

Don't you dare fool me
'Cause you make me feel
Closer to the moon
Than I've ever been
Air's cold and clear
If only you were here

Stranger from afar
From beyond the stars
I'm floating higher, higher
It's foolishness of youth
Illusions in the blooth
Trapped, clouded by desire

Rest on my lap
I'll gently tap
Here on your head
It's alright, it's okay
But you're still unreal, that's a curse
I'd eat every pixel of yours
'Cause you were designed just for me
Drawn for me, for me, for me

Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer to the moon
Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer

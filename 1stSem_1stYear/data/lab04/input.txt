Early Sunday morning
Thousand drinks I’ve understood
Driving with my darling
Faster as I should
A green man stops me friendly
One look — he starts to smile
He says:"never let me see your face again"
I’m easy for a while
But I think, I’m a fool
Try to breath under water
Driving with my darling
Faster than I should
Driving with my darling
Forever if we could
Fool is on the road again
So danger isn’t far
Bang! deep green crashing metal
Police just lost a car
